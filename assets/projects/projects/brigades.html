  <h1>Global Engineering Brigades — Sustainable Water System (In Progress)</h1>

  <p><strong>Status:</strong> Ongoing — Spring 2026</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    As part of Boston University’s Global Engineering Brigades, I am working on a multidisciplinary team
    to design and implement a sustainable clean water system for communities in Guatemala with limited
    access to safe drinking water.
  </p>

  <h2>My role</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Supporting requirements gathering and constraint analysis (cost, materials, maintenance)</li>
    <li>Assisting in system design (filtration, storage, and distribution)</li>
    <li>Planning testing and validation for water quality and system performance</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Skills & tools</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Engineering design and systems thinking</li>
    <li>Team-based problem solving</li>
    <li>Impact-driven project planning</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why this matters</h2>
  <p>
    Access to clean water is a foundational public health issue. This project aims to deliver a solution
    that is not only technically sound, but also locally maintainable and culturally appropriate for
    long-term sustainability.
  </p>

  <h2>Next milestones</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Finalize system design</li>
    <li>Field installation in Guatemala</li>
    <li>Post-installation testing and iteration</li>
  </ul>
